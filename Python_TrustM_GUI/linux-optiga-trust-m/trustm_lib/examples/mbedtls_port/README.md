**Note A.** If you want to use these files standalone, please keep in mind, that you need to [initialise](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m/wiki/Initialisation-hints) your chip prior calling the API.

**Note B.** Please keep in mind, that this mbedTLS interface implementation doesn't use private key provided by a user `d`. It relies on keys preconfigured at compilation time; e.g. like [here](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m/blob/master/examples/mbedtls_port/trustm_ecdsa.c#L45), [here](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m/blob/master/examples/mbedtls_port/trustm_ecdh.c#L42), and [here](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m/blob/master/examples/mbedtls_port/trustm_rsa.c#L81).
